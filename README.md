**Editor Navigation:** Launch Switcher++ directly into editor mode using a shortcut, filter the currently open editors to find the `Format your notes` editor and make it active. Then use Switcher++ again to open the `backlinks` side panel.

## Search headings instead of filename

Find the file you're looking for by searching through the headings contained in the file, instead of only searching the filename. This mode can be configured to search a) strictly through only the first H1 header, fallback to filename search if there's no match with the H1, b) through all headers, and c) respect the builtin Quick Switcher settings `Show existing only`, `Show attachments`, and `Show all file types`. By default, this mode will display the first top 50 results.

### Search headings configuration

| Setting                  | Description | Default |
|--------------------------|-------------|---------|
| Headings list mode trigger | Character that will trigger headings list mode in the switcher. | `#` |
| Show headings only | **Enabled**: strictly search through only the first H1 contained in the file. <br />**Disabled**: if there is not a match in the first H1, fallback to search against the filename. This will also search through Aliases, and Unresolved links. | disabled |

## Symbol Navigation (Headings, Hashtags, Links, Embeddings)

View, filter, and navigate to any symbol (Headings, Hashtags, Links, Embedding) in a file directly from the Quick Switcher.

**For the currently open and focused pane:** symbols can be viewed directly by using the `Open in Symbol Mode` global hotkey (see below).

**For any other file (open or not):** symbols can be viewed by opening Quick Switcher++, typing some characters to filter and/or using the arrow keys to select (highlight) the file of interest. Then, once the file of interest is selected/highlighted, type the `@` (default) character to view the symbols for the file of interest.

## Navigate between open editors

View, and filter all of the currently open editors, and navigate to any of them from Quick Switcher++ by using the default `edt ` command. Note: Symbol search works in this mode as well, so you can use both modes together e.g. `edt @`. The default builtin Quick Switcher behavior is used when no commands are present.

Editors/views from the side panels can be configured to be displayed in the list as well. For example, you could use this to navigate to the `backlinks`, `file explorer`, `tag pane`, etc.. system views/panes directly from the Quick Switcher.

## Contributing

Contributions via bug fixes, documentation, and general improvements are always welcome. For more major feature work, please create a [Discussion](https://github.com/darlal/obsidian-switcher-plus/discussions) about the feature idea, or reach out to me so we can judge feasibility and how best to implement it.

A primary design goal for Switcher++ is to be a "drop in" replacement for the built-in system Switcher. Such that, a user can simply replace the built-in system Switcher with Switcher++ and have all the built-in functionality continue to work as expected.

### Getting started

* Clone the repository
* `cd` into the repository directory
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run dev` this will monitor for any source file changes and run unit tests, linter, and build the plugin whenever a change is detected.
* Happy coding! 😀

## Change Log

* See the [releases page](https://github.com/darlal/obsidian-switcher-plus/releases) for changes in each release.

## Notes

* This plugin very much experimental at the moment, use it at your own risk. It's only been tested on MacOS, other platforms may have issues.
